This is simple Java program to find out if given string is a Palindrome or not. 

Logic - Idea is to iterate thrugh the string and compare it with the original value.
Then, traverse through string characters from start and end of the string till we reach middle of the string.

if its empty string or single letter then consider it as palindrone.
