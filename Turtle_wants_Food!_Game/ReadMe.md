Turtle Wants Food!!!

Aim of the game : You have to feed Turtle
But how?
Ofcourse, you will control the turtle to get to the food.

Controls :

'w' - Up
's' - Down
'a' - Left
'd' - Right

Simple right! 

But the twist is ---> Turtle can't go reverse!
For example, if your turtle is moving up, your 's' keyword(down) won't work to get the turtle move downwards
So, you will have to make the turtle move left or right and then go downwards.

Everytime, turtle touches the food you will get 10 points and food shifts to other place on screen.

If your turtle touches the edges of the screen, 
Oops! you lose and have to start again.

Have Fun!
