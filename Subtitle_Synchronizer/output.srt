3
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,437
Look at me.
Look at me!

4
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:12,640
Do you remember
me now, boy, eh?

5
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,409
Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

6
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,079
You'll be coming
with me, boy,

7
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:22,115
and you'll be keeping
your mouth shut.

8
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:41,567
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!

9
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:44,737
You're not a <i>smart</i> boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

10
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:47,507
Do you want
to live, boy?!

11
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,513
North, boy,
we're going north.

12
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:27,882
It had three eyes.

13
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,618
It told me to come
with him, so I did.

14
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:34,387
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

15
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,257
Your father's not
down there, little lord.

16
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,559
Not for many years yet.

17
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,929
You're afraid--
just like Hodor.

18
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:46,098
I'm not afraid of some hole
in the ground.

19
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:49,369
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?

20
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:52,539
I'm a crippled boy
and I'm willing to go.

21
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,679
That's my grandfather
Lord Rickard.

22
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:04,016
He was burned alive
by the Mad King Aerys.

23
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,454
That's Lyanna,
my father's sister.

24
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:10,390
<i>King Robert was</i>
<i>supposed to marry her,</i>

25
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:13,494
<i>but Rhaegar Targaryen</i>
<i>kidnapped her.</i>

26
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,996
<i>Robert started a war</i>
<i>to win her back.</i>

27
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:19,200
<i>He killed Rhaegar,</i>
<i>but she died anyway.</i>

28
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:22,770
That's where
I saw father.

29
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:27,640
You see?
He's not here.

30
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:38,284
-<i>Here, Shaggydog.</i>
-Rickon!

31
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,219
That beast

32
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:42,655
is supposed to be
chained in the kennels!

33
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,892
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

34
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:49,262
- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see father.

35
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:51,931
How many times have I told you?
He's in King's Landing

36
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,134
with Sansa and Arya.

37
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,570
He was down here.
I saw him.

38
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:58,338
Saw him when?

39
00:04:58,372 --> 00:05:00,173
<i>Last night,</i>

40
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:02,842
when I was sleeping.

41
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:05,377
Here, Shaggydog.

42
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:12,250
You both miss him.

43
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:15,286
It's only natural
he should be in your thoughts

44
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:19,123
and dreams,
but that doesn't mean that--

45
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:21,927
Bran...

46
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:41,415
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

47
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,250
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

48
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:45,752
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

49
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:48,888
My Lady.

50
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:38,171
Robb.

51
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:41,441
Robb.

52
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:47,380
<i>Robb!</i>

53
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:53,753
You've ruined your sword.

54
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:05,665
Shh shh.

55
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,434
- Shh.
- I'll kill them all--

56
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,971
--Every one of them.

57
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:15,241
I will kill them all.

58
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,646
My boy.

59
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,216
They have your sisters.

60
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:27,553
We have to get
the girls back.

61
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:32,325
And then we will
kill them all.

Isn't it a funny song?

77
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:49,973
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for your rendition.</i>

78
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,975
I imagine it was even better
received at that tavern.

79
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,044
I'm so sorry,
Your Grace.

80
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,045
I'll never sing it again,
I swear.

81
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,214
Tell me,
which do you favor:

82
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,950
<i>Your fingers</i>
<i>or your tongue?</i>

83
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:03,652
Your Grace?

84
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:05,588
Fingers
or your tongue?

85
00:09:05,622 --> 00:09:08,758
If you got to keep one,
which would it be?

86
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,461
I-- I--

87
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:13,730
or I could just
cut your throat.

88
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,567
Every man needs hands,
Your Grace.

89
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:19,169
Good.

90
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:22,038
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

91
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:24,140
I won't sing--
Your Grace.

92
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:26,309
Ser Ilyn,
who better than you

93
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:28,445
- to carry out the sentence?
- I beg you!

94
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,980
Please no.

95
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:33,383
<i>No!</i>

96
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:38,521
Your Grace, please.
I beg you, I will never sing again!

97
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,457
- I'm done for the day.
- <i>No-oooo!</i>

98
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:43,103
I'll leave the rest
of the matters to you, mother.

99
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,933
Your Grace, please!

100
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,210
You look quite nice.

101
00:09:58,245 --> 00:09:59,979
Thank you, My Lord.

102
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,481
"Your Grace."
I'm King now.

103
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:05,918
<i>Stop-ppp!</i>
<i>No!</i>

104
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,720
Walk with me.
I want to show you something.

105
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,827
Do as you're bid, child.

106
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,103
...And as soon as you've had
your blood, I'll put a son in you.

107
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:27,907
Mother says that
shouldn't be long.

108
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:34,080
No, please no!

109
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:35,948
This one's your father.

110
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:39,185
This one here.

111
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,654
Look at it and see
what happens to traitors.

112
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:45,691
- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.

113
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:47,994
I gave him
a clean death.

114
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:50,696
Look at him.

115
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,032
Please let me go home.
I won't do any treason, I swear.

116
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:57,602
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here

117
00:10:57,636 --> 00:11:00,305
and obey.

118
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:02,640
Look at him!

119
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:12,885
<i>Well?</i>

120
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,822
How long
do I have to look?

121
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:20,060
As long as it pleases me.

122
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:24,198
Do you want
to see the rest?

123
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:26,467
If it please Your Grace.

124
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:28,803
That's your Septa there.

125
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,106
<i>I'll tell you what:</i>

126
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,475
I'm going to give you
a present.

127
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:38,279
After I raise my armies
and kill your traitor brother,

128
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:40,781
I'm going to give you
his head as well.

129
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:43,517
Or maybe he'll
give me yours.

130
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:52,191
My mother tells me a King
should never strike his lady.

131
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,128
Ser Meryn.

132
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,984
Here, girl.

133
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:24,389
Will you obey now?

134
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:26,958
Or do you need
another lesson?

135
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,698
I'll look for you
in court.

136
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,803
Save yourself
some pain, girl.

137
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:39,805
Give him what he wants.

138
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,575
You'll be
needing that again.

139
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:07,033
The proper course
is clear:

140
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:09,503
Pledge fealty to King Renly
and move south

141
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:11,572
to join our forces
with his.

142
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:14,341
<i>Renly is not the King.</i>

143
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,611
You cannot mean
to hold to Joffrey, My Lord.

144
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:19,446
He put your father
to death.

145
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,381
That doesn't
make Renly King.

146
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,151
He's Robert's
<i>youngest</i> brother.

147
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:27,287
If Bran can't be Lord
of Winterfell before me,

148
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:29,289
<i>Renly can't be King</i>
<i>before Stannis.</i>

149
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:31,391
Do you mean to declare us
for Stannis?

150
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:33,274
- Renly is not right!
- My Lords.

151
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:35,044
If we put ourselves
behind Stannis--

152
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:36,269
My Lords!

153
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:40,266
Here is what I say
to these two Kings--

154
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,938
Renly Baratheon
is nothing to me,

155
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:48,341
nor Stannis neither.

156
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,910
Why should they rule
over me and mine

157
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:53,079
from some flowery seat
in the South?

158
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:57,316
<i>What do they know of the Wall</i>
<i>or the Wolfswood?</i>

159
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:00,319
Even their Gods
are wrong!

160
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:06,659
Why shouldn't we rule
ourselves again?

161
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:09,829
It was the Dragons
we bowed to

162
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:12,932
and now the Dragons
are dead!

163
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:17,270
There sits the only King

164
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:20,540
I mean to bend
my knee to--

165
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:22,975
the King
in the North!

166
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:32,418
I'll have peace
on those terms.

167
00:14:32,453 --> 00:14:35,122
<i>They can keep</i>
<i>their Red Castle</i>

168
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:38,025
and their Iron Chair too.

169
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:41,028
The King
in the North!

170
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:45,933
Am I your brother,
now and always?

171
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:47,568
Now and always.

172
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:54,243
My sword is yours,
in victory and defeat

173
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:57,380
from this day
until my last day.

174
00:14:58,548 --> 00:14:59,982
The King
in the North!

175
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:03,920
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

176
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:06,456
The King
in the North!

177
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,358
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

178
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:11,459
The King
in the North!

179
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,594
The King in the North!

180
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,730
The King
in the North!

181
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:17,398
<i>The King in the North!</i>

182
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:23,404
<i>The King in the North!</i>
<i>The King in the North!</i>

183
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:30,278
- Lady Stark.
- I want to see him.

184
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,980
Now!

185
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,602
Leave us.

186
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:03,111
You look lovely
tonight, Lady Stark.

187
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:05,546
<i>Widowhood becomes you.</i>

188
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,317
Your bed must be lonely.

189
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:12,119
Is that why you came?

190
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:14,755
<i>I'm not at my best,</i>

191
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:16,991
but I think I could
be of service.

192
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:20,861
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if I'm up to it.

193
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,368
Oh, I do like
a violent woman.

194
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:31,338
I will kill you
tonight, Ser,

195
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:35,176
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

196
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,711
<i>Let me show you how--</i>

197
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,247
hit me again,
over the ear.

198
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:41,215
And again and again.

199
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,252
You're stronger than you look--
it shouldn't take long.

200
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:46,220
That is what you want
the world to believe,

201
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,089
isn't it?
That you don't fear death.

202
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:49,957
But I don't, My Lady.

203
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:53,527
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

204
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:56,129
Because you are going
to the deepest

205
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:58,565
of the Seven Hells,
if the Gods are just.

206
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,767
What Gods are those?

207
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:03,503
The trees your husband
prayed to?

208
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:08,108
<i>Where were the trees when his</i>
<i>head was getting chopped off?</i>

209
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:11,078
If your Gods are real
and if they are just,

210
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:14,247
why is the world
so full of injustice?

211
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:18,518
Because of men like you.

212
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:21,188
There are no men like me.

213
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,191
Only me.

214
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:31,700
My son Bran.

215
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,303
How did he come to fall
from that tower?

216
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:37,906
I pushed him
out the window.

217
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:41,910
Why?

218
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,382
I hoped the fall
would kill him.

219
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,450
Why?

220
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,193
You should get some sleep.

221
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:00,629
It's going to be
a long war.

222
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:27,991
I can't believe
we're actually at war.

223
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:32,296
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

224
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:38,102
What does it say?

225
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:41,238
Have we captured
Robb Stark yet?

226
00:18:41,273 --> 00:18:44,174
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

227
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:47,411
Get back into bed.

228
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:57,386
They have my son.

229
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,125
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

230
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,429
I've heard his wolf killed a doze
men and as many horses.

231
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:08,230
Is it true about
Stannis and Renly?

232
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:11,033
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

233
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,636
Jaime captured,
his armies scattered...

234
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,571
It's a catastrophe.

235
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,607
Perhaps we should
sue for peace.

236
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:24,214
There's your peace.

237
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:28,217
Joffrey saw to that when h
decided to remove Ned Stark's head.

238
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:31,688
<i>You'll have an easier time</i>
<i>drinking from that cup</i>

239
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:35,025
<i>than you will bringing Robb Stark</i>
<i>to the table now.</i>

240
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:36,560
He's winning...

241
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:38,562
in case you
hadn't noticed.

242
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,097
I'm told we still
have his sisters.

243
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:42,766
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

244
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:44,669
No truces.
We can't afford to look weak.

245
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:46,304
<i>We should march</i>
<i>on them at once.</i>

246
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:48,940
<i>First we must return</i>
<i>to Casterly Rock to raise--</i>

247
00:19:48,974 --> 00:19:51,442
They have my son!

248
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,181
Get out, all of you.

249
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,894
Not you.

250
00:20:23,776 --> 00:20:26,679
You were right
about Eddard Stark.

251
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:30,515
If he were alive,
we could have used him

252
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:33,818
to broker a peace
with Winterfell and Riverrun,

253
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:36,187
which would have
given us more time

254
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:39,057
to deal with Robert's brothers.
But now...

255
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:43,328
Madness--
madness and stupidity.

256
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:49,335
I always thought
you were a stunted fool.

257
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:52,638
Perhaps I was wrong.

258
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,942
Half wrong.

259
00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:58,713
I'm new to strategy, but--

260
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:00,981
unless we want to be
surrounded by three armies,

261
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:03,050
<i>it appears we can't</i>
<i>stay here.</i>

262
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:04,985
No one will stay here.

263
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:08,454
Ser Gregor will head out
with 500 riders

264
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:12,392
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

265
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:15,895
The rest of us will
regroup at Harrenhal.

266
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:20,133
And you will go
to King's Landing.

267
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,368
And do what?

268
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:24,304
Rule!

269
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:27,206
You will serve as Hand
of the King in my stead.

270
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,276
You will bring that boy King to heel
and his mother too, if needs be.

271
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,980
And if you get so much as a whiff
of treason from any of the rest:

272
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:38,050
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle--
- Heads, spikes, walls.

273
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:41,287
Why not my Uncle?

274
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:43,889
Why not anyone?
Why me?

275
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:46,492
You're my son.

276
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:56,002
Oh, one more thing:

277
00:21:56,037 --> 00:21:59,439
You will not take
the whore to court.

278
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:01,407
Do you understand?

279
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,295
Ser Jorah?

280
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:29,868
Gently gently.

281
00:22:31,603 --> 00:22:33,337
My son...

282
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:35,873
Where is he?
I want him.

283
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,277
Where is he?

284
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:44,615
The boy did not live.

285
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:54,426
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

286
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:56,862
How did my son die?!

287
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:01,367
He never lived,
My Princess.

288
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:03,469
The women say...

289
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:05,271
What do the women say?

290
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:11,144
- They say the child was--
- <i>Monstrous,</i>

291
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:12,812
twisted.

292
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:14,847
I pulled him out
myself.

293
00:23:16,283 --> 00:23:18,751
He was scaled
like a lizard,

294
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:23,155
<i>blind, with leather wings</i>
<i>like the wings of a bat.</i>

295
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,425
When I touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

296
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:30,396
Inside he was
full of graveworms.

297
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:37,170
I warned you that only death
can pay for life.

298
00:23:37,204 --> 00:23:39,339
You knew the price.

299
00:23:39,373 --> 00:23:42,309
Where is Khal Drogo?

300
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:44,444
Show him to me.

301
00:23:44,478 --> 00:23:47,013
Show me what I bought

302
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:49,949
with my son's life.

303
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:52,051
As you command, lady.

304
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:53,752
Come.

305
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:55,587
I will take you
to him.

306
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:58,556
- Time enough for that later--
- I want to see him now.

307
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:16,510
The Khalasar is gone.

308
00:24:16,544 --> 00:24:19,146
A Khal who cannot ride
is no Khal.

309
00:24:19,181 --> 00:24:22,016
The Dothraki
follow only the strong.

310
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,718
I'm sorry, My Princess.

311
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:37,665
Drogo!

312
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:43,704
Why is he out here alone?

313
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,507
He seems to like
the warmth, Princess.

314
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:52,480
<i>He lives.</i>

315
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:55,316
<i>You asked for life,</i>
<i>you paid for life.</i>

316
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,952
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

317
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:01,355
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east

318
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,424
<i>when the seas go dry.</i>

319
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:07,228
When the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

320
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:24,080
Leave us.

321
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:27,817
I don't want you alone
with this sorceress.

322
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:31,054
I have nothing more
to fear from this woman.

323
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:33,556
Go.

324
00:25:39,396 --> 00:25:42,732
You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.

325
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:45,634
It was wrong of them
to burn my temple.

326
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,605
- <i>It angered the Great Shepherd.</i>
- This is not God's work.

327
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:52,274
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

328
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:55,577
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

329
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:57,056
Now he will burn no cities.

330
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,632
Now his Khalasar will trample
no nations into dust.

331
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,351
I spoke for you.

332
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:04,587
I saved you.

333
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:07,222
Saved me?

334
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:09,357
Three of those riders
had already

335
00:26:09,392 --> 00:26:12,127
raped me before
you saved me, girl.

336
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:17,833
I saw my God's house burn,

337
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:22,237
there where I had healed men
and women beyond counting.

338
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:24,939
In the streets
I saw piles of heads--

339
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:27,509
the head of the Baker
who makes my bread,

340
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:28,943
the head of a young boy

341
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:31,813
that I had cured of fever
just three moons past.

342
00:26:31,847 --> 00:26:35,817
So tell me again
exactly what it was

343
00:26:35,851 --> 00:26:37,219
that you saved.

344
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:39,187
Your life.

345
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:41,222
Hmph.

346
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:43,858
Why don't you take
a look at your Khal...

347
00:26:45,628 --> 00:26:48,463
Then you will see
exactly what life is worth

348
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:51,299
when all the rest has gone.

349
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:06,214
You can't!

350
00:27:06,248 --> 00:27:08,450
Get out of my way, Sam.

351
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:10,785
They'll put out the word.

352
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,722
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

353
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:16,592
Do you know what happens
to deserters?

354
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:21,196
Better than you do.

355
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,899
What are you going to do?

356
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,834
I'm gonna find my brother

357
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:28,904
and put a sword through
King Joffrey's throat.

358
00:27:30,073 --> 00:27:33,209
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

359
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:37,246
- Move.
- I won't let you go.

360
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,182
- Move.
- No.

361
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:42,918
Hyah!

362
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,572
Hand of the King?

363
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:02,607
So it would seem.

364
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:07,145
And your father said you couldn't take
anyone with you to King's Landing.

365
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,115
No, he said I couldn't take <i>you</i>
with me to King's Landing.

366
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:11,817
He was very specific
on that point.

367
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:13,852
He knew my name?

368
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:15,620
What?

369
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:18,222
He said, "Don't bring Shae
with you to King's Landing"?

370
00:28:18,257 --> 00:28:21,358
I believe he used
the word "whore."

371
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:24,494
Are you ashamed of me?

372
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,564
Are you afraid that I'm dancing
around the court with my tits out?

373
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:30,700
I'm funny now?

374
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:32,936
I'm Shae the funny whore.

375
00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:37,407
My father's probably the most
powerful man in the country.

376
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:38,708
Certainly the richest.

377
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:41,344
<i>He has all Seven Kingdoms</i>
<i>in his pockets.</i>

378
00:28:41,378 --> 00:28:43,179
Everyone everywhere

379
00:28:43,213 --> 00:28:46,349
always has to do exactly
what my father says.

380
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:49,786
He's always been a cunt.

381
00:28:56,728 --> 00:28:58,395
I believe the ladies
of the court

382
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,532
<i>could learn a great deal</i>
<i>from a girl like you.</i>

383
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:05,503
Why don't you
come with me,

384
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:08,272
<i>be the Hand's lady?</i>

385
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:12,476
Because the King needs
a Hand and the Hand--

386
00:29:16,848 --> 00:29:19,584
I know what
a Hand needs.

387
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:34,533
- Ghost?
- <i>Hyah!</i>

388
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:37,436
- Hyah.
- Hyah!

389
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:42,475
Hyah.

390
00:29:45,112 --> 00:29:48,014
<i>Samwell!</i>

391
00:29:49,283 --> 00:29:51,918
<i>- Is he dead?</i>
<i>- No, he's not dead.</i>

392
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:53,520
<i>Did we get him?</i>

393
00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:55,655
<i>Come on, help me</i>
<i>get him up.</i>

394
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:01,194
Lucky you've got
plenty of padding.

395
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:05,065
We're taking you back
to where you belong.

396
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:07,701
- I belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

397
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:10,003
They'll kill you if they find out
you've gone.

398
00:30:10,037 --> 00:30:12,138
They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.

399
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:15,175
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

400
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:18,078
- <i>We're sorry about your father.</i>
- But it doesn't matter.

401
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,347
You took the oath.
You can't leave.

402
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:22,516
- I have to.
- You can't.

403
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,052
- You said the words.
- I don't care about--

404
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:28,222
"Hear my words and bear
witness to my vow..."

405
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:30,194
To hell with all of you.

406
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:32,541
"Night gathers and now
my Watch begins.

407
00:30:32,695 --> 00:30:36,031
It shall not end
until my death.

408
00:30:36,065 --> 00:30:37,832
I shall live and die
at my post."

409
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:39,768
"I am the sword
in the darkness..."

410
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:41,836
"...The Watcher on the Walls,

411
00:30:41,871 --> 00:30:44,273
the shield that guards
the realms of men.

412
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:48,010
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch,

413
00:30:48,044 --> 00:30:52,147
for this night
and all nights to come."

414
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:38,387
When the sun

415
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,823
rises in the west

416
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,293
and sets in the east...

417
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:50,999
Then you shall return
to me, my sun and stars.

418
00:33:58,234 --> 00:34:00,669
Kings?

419
00:34:00,703 --> 00:34:04,773
Oh, I can tell you all
there is to know about Kings.

420
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:09,945
The thing you need to
understand about Kings is...

421
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:18,521
For the past 67 years,
I've known--

422
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:23,627
truly known more Kings
than any man alive.

423
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:29,699
They're complicated men,
but I know how to serve them.

424
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,635
Yes.

425
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,271
And keep on serving them.

426
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,277
Aerys Targaryen...

427
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:44,782
of all the thousand thousand
maladies the Gods visit on us,

428
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:48,518
madness is the worst.

429
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:51,454
He was a good man,

430
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:54,657
such a charmer.

431
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:58,828
To watch him melt away
before my eyes,

432
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:00,896
consumed by dreams

433
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:04,099
of fire and blood...

434
00:35:06,803 --> 00:35:09,105
Robert Baratheon

435
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:12,074
was an entirely different animal--
powerful man,

436
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:14,244
a great warrior--

437
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,247
but alas,
winning a Kingdom

438
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:21,218
and ruling a Kingdom
are rather different things.

439
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,553
They say that

440
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,023
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

441
00:35:27,057 --> 00:35:29,358
he can often be blind

442
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:32,228
to the enemies at his side.

443
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:37,866
Now I serve his son

444
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,134
King Joffrey,

445
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:42,370
may the Gods
bless his reign.

446
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,443
He is a capable young man--
strong military mind.

447
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:50,713
Stern...

448
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:54,718
But sternness in defense
of the realm is no vice.

449
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,389
It's far too soon to know what
manner of King he will be,

450
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,024
but I sense

451
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:06,095
true greatness on the horizon
for our new King.

452
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,566
True greatness.

453
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,938
So what's the thing?

454
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,408
What thing?

455
00:36:20,476 --> 00:36:22,110
About Kings.

456
00:36:22,145 --> 00:36:25,280
You said, "the thing you need
to understand about Kings..."

457
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:28,049
What? Things?
What?

458
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:30,885
When you started, you--
never mind.

459
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,955
Let me see you
out, my dear.

460
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:37,892
- It's all right. No need.
- <i>Yes yes.</i>

461
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:40,360
Till the next time.

462
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,248
Right.

463
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:31,678
When you imagine yourself up
there, how do you look?

464
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:35,883
Does the crown fit?
Do all the lords and ladies

465
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:39,753
simper and bow, the ones who
sneered at you for years?

466
00:37:39,787 --> 00:37:43,089
It's hard for them to simper
and bow without heads.

467
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:46,893
A man with great ambition
and no morals--

468
00:37:46,928 --> 00:37:49,295
I wouldn't
bet against you.

469
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,131
And what would you do,
my friend,

470
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:53,533
if you found yourself
sitting up there?

471
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:57,436
I must be one of the few men
in this city

472
00:37:57,471 --> 00:37:59,105
who doesn't
want to be King.

473
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:01,174
You must be one
of the few men in the city

474
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,542
who isn't a man.

475
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:04,445
Oh, you can do
better than that.

476
00:38:08,783 --> 00:38:12,085
When they castrated you, did they
take the pillar with the stones?

477
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,054
- I've always wondered.
- Have you?

478
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:17,091
Do you spend a lot of time wondering
what's between my legs?

479
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:20,227
I picture a gash

480
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:22,696
like a woman's.
Is that about right?

481
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,565
I am flattered, of course,
to be pictured at all.

482
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,168
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years--

483
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:32,238
a man from another land,

484
00:38:32,272 --> 00:38:34,940
despised by most,

485
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:36,408
feared by all--

486
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:38,010
am I?
That is good to know.

487
00:38:38,044 --> 00:38:41,313
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

488
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:45,250
But you carry on,
whispering in one King's ear

489
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:47,886
and then the next.

490
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,857
I admire you.

491
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:54,560
And I admire you,
Lord Baelish.

492
00:38:54,594 --> 00:38:57,597
A grasper from a minor house
with a major talent

493
00:38:57,631 --> 00:38:59,766
<i>for befriending</i>
<i>powerful men--</i>

494
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,897
and women.

495
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,648
A useful talent,
I'm sure you'd agree.

496
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:08,741
So here we stand...

497
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:11,977
In mutual admiration
and respect.

498
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:14,179
Playing our roles.

499
00:39:14,214 --> 00:39:16,081
Serving a new King.

500
00:39:16,115 --> 00:39:18,050
Long may he reign.

501
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:20,319
- My King.
- My King.

502
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:24,690
My Lords.
Shall we begin?

503
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:27,727
<i>You're Arry now, hear me?</i>

504
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:29,996
Arry the orphan boy.

505
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,298
No one asks an orphan
too many questions

506
00:39:32,332 --> 00:39:34,534
'cause nobody gives
three shits.

507
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:35,869
What's your name?

508
00:39:35,903 --> 00:39:37,671
- Arry.
- Ah.

509
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:41,275
We have a long way
to travel and in bad company.

510
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:43,477
I have 20 this time,

511
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:45,579
men and boys all
bound for the Wall.

512
00:39:45,613 --> 00:39:49,316
Your Lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons

513
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,485
and I didn't find
no little lordlings down there.

514
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,756
This lot, half of them would
turn you over to the King

515
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,891
quick as spit for a pardon.

516
00:39:57,925 --> 00:39:59,960
And the other half
would do the same,

517
00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:02,196
except they'd
rape you first.

518
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,531
So keep to yourself--
and when you piss,

519
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:06,733
do it in the woods alone.

520
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,436
You stay
with this lot, boy.

521
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:12,071
And stay--

522
00:40:12,106 --> 00:40:15,942
or I'll lock you in the back of
the wagon with these three.

523
00:40:19,813 --> 00:40:21,614
Watch yourself,
midget.

524
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:24,884
He's got a sword,
this one.

525
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:27,421
What's a gutter rat
like you doing with a sword?

526
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:30,658
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

527
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:32,293
He looks like a girl.

528
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:34,528
I bet he stole
that sword.

529
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:37,197
Let's have a look.

530
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,468
I could use me
a sword like that.

531
00:40:41,503 --> 00:40:43,737
- <i>Take it off him.</i>
- Give it here, midget.

532
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:44,938
Look at him!

533
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:47,073
You'd better give
Hot Pie the sword.

534
00:40:47,108 --> 00:40:48,809
I've seen him
kick a boy to death.

535
00:40:48,843 --> 00:40:51,211
I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls

536
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:53,613
and I kept kicking him
until he was dead.

537
00:40:53,648 --> 00:40:57,083
I kicked him
all to pieces.

538
00:40:57,117 --> 00:41:00,153
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

539
00:41:00,187 --> 00:41:02,021
I'll give it to you.

540
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:04,758
I already killed
one fat boy.

541
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:07,026
I bet you never
killed anyone.

542
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:10,096
I bet you're a liar.
But I'm not.

543
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:11,898
I'm good at killing
fat boys.

544
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:14,234
I like killing fat boys.

545
00:41:15,636 --> 00:41:17,871
Oh, you like picking
on the little ones, do you?

546
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:20,741
You know, I've been hammering
an anvil these past 10 years.

547
00:41:20,775 --> 00:41:23,811
When I hit
that steel, it sings.

548
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,146
Are you gonna sing
when I hit you?

549
00:41:32,787 --> 00:41:35,021
This is
castle-forged steel.

550
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:37,189
Where'd you steal it?

551
00:41:37,224 --> 00:41:39,658
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

552
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:42,294
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

553
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:45,431
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen--

554
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:47,533
murderers.

555
00:41:47,567 --> 00:41:51,070
- Which are you?
- Armorer's apprentice.

556
00:41:52,406 --> 00:41:55,074
But my master
got sick of me,

557
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:56,376
so here I am.

558
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,412
<i>Come on, you sorry</i>
<i>sons of whores!</i>

559
00:41:59,447 --> 00:42:02,748
It's a thousand leagues
from here to the Wall

560
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:05,417
and winter is coming!

561
00:42:35,949 --> 00:42:37,883
Ham.

562
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:40,386
How many days in a row
must a man be

563
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:43,023
expected to start
his day with ham?

564
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:46,026
Bring me some beer
at least.

565
00:42:48,062 --> 00:42:49,997
You look exhausted.

566
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:52,266
Was your moonlight ride
that tiring?

567
00:42:55,904 --> 00:42:57,771
Don't look so terrified.

568
00:42:57,806 --> 00:43:00,675
If we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

569
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:03,244
only ghosts
would guard the Wall.

570
00:43:03,278 --> 00:43:06,815
At least you weren't
whoring in Mole's Town.

571
00:43:07,783 --> 00:43:09,551
Honor made you leave,

572
00:43:09,585 --> 00:43:11,387
honor brought you back.

573
00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:14,556
My friends
brought me back.

574
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:17,327
I didn't say
it was your honor.

575
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,296
They killed my father.

576
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,099
And you're going to bring him
back to life, are you?

577
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,468
No? Good.

578
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:27,304
We've had enough
of that sort of thing.

579
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,373
Beyond the Wall,
the rangers are

580
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,875
reporting whole villages
abandoned.

581
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,279
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

582
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,380
from dusk until dawn.

583
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:43,051
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

584
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:46,689
<i>to what ends</i>
<i>the Gods only know.</i>

585
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:48,957
Outside Eastwatch

586
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:52,361
Cotter Pyke's men discovered four
blue-eyed corpses.

587
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:56,798
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

588
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:01,870
Do you think
your brother's war

589
00:44:01,904 --> 00:44:04,405
is more important
than ours?

590
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:09,144
- No.
- When dead men and worse

591
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:12,080
come hunting for us in the night,
do you think it matters

592
00:44:12,114 --> 00:44:14,617
<i>who sits</i>
<i>on the Iron Throne?</i>

593
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:17,086
- No.
- Good.

594
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,990
Because I want you
and your wolf with us

595
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,226
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

596
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,362
Beyond the Wall?

597
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,131
I'll not sit meekly by

598
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,099
and wait for the snows.

599
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,535
<i>I mean to find out</i>
<i>what's happening.</i>

600
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,238
<i>The Night's Watch will</i>
<i>ride in force</i>

601
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:37,874
<i>against the wildlings,</i>
<i>the White Walkers</i>

602
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,910
<i>and whatever else</i>
<i>is out there.</i>

603
00:44:42,581 --> 00:44:45,249
<i>And we will find Benjen Stark,</i>

604
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:47,485
<i>alive or dead.</i>

605
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,755
<i>I will command them</i>
<i>myself.</i>

606
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:52,990
<i>So I'll only ask you once,</i>
<i>Lord Snow...</i>

607
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:55,660
<i>Move out!</i>

608
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:58,363
<i>...Are you a brother</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch</i>

609
00:44:58,397 --> 00:45:02,200
<i>or a bastard boy</i>
<i>who wants to play at war?</i>

610
00:45:44,811 --> 00:45:48,246
Drogo will have no use for
dragon eggs in the Night Lands.

611
00:45:48,281 --> 00:45:51,416
Sell them. You can return
to the Free Cities

612
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,785
and live as a wealthy woman
for all your days.

613
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,321
They were not
given to me to sell.

614
00:46:01,794 --> 00:46:04,362
Khaleesi, My Queen,

615
00:46:04,397 --> 00:46:07,733
I vow to serve you,
obey you,

616
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:10,102
to die for you
if need be,

617
00:46:10,136 --> 00:46:12,905
but let him go,
Khaleesi.

618
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,708
I know what you intend.
Do not.

619
00:46:15,743 --> 00:46:18,578
I must.

620
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,713
You don't understand--

621
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:24,250
don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

622
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:26,786
I won't watch you burn.

623
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:30,591
Is that what you fear?

624
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:52,312
You will be my Khalasar.

625
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:55,782
I see the faces of slaves.

626
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:58,451
I free you.

627
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:03,189
Take off your collars. Go if yo
wish, no one will stop you.

628
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:05,692
But if you stay,

629
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:09,396
it will be as
brothers and sisters,

630
00:47:09,464 --> 00:47:13,066
<i>as husbands and wives.</i>

631
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:26,312
Ser Jorah, bind this woman
to the pyre.

632
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,285
You swore to obey me.

633
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,899
I am Daenerys Stormborn

634
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:45,701
of House Targaryen

635
00:47:45,735 --> 00:47:47,970
of the blood of Old Valyria.

636
00:47:48,004 --> 00:47:50,606
I am the Dragon's daughter.

637
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,075
And I swear to you

638
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,680
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

639
00:47:56,714 --> 00:47:58,582
You will not
hear me scream.

640
00:47:58,616 --> 00:48:00,650
I will.

641
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:05,155
But it is not
your screams I want.

642
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,692
Only your life.

643
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,778
Blood of my blood.
