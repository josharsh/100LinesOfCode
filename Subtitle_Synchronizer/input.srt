3
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,937
Look at me.
Look at me!

4
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:13,140
Do you remember
me now, boy, eh?

5
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,909
Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

6
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,579
You'll be coming
with me, boy,

7
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:22,615
and you'll be keeping
your mouth shut.

8
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:42,067
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!

9
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:45,237
You're not a <i>smart</i> boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

10
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,007
Do you want
to live, boy?!

11
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:53,013
North, boy,
we're going north.

12
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:28,382
It had three eyes.

13
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,118
It told me to come
with him, so I did.

14
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:34,887
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

15
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:37,757
Your father's not
down there, little lord.

16
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,059
Not for many years yet.

17
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:44,429
You're afraid--
just like Hodor.

18
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:46,598
I'm not afraid of some hole
in the ground.

19
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,869
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?

20
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:53,039
I'm a crippled boy
and I'm willing to go.

21
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:01,179
That's my grandfather
Lord Rickard.

22
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:04,516
He was burned alive
by the Mad King Aerys.

23
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,954
That's Lyanna,
my father's sister.

24
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:10,890
<i>King Robert was</i>
<i>supposed to marry her,</i>

25
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:13,994
<i>but Rhaegar Targaryen</i>
<i>kidnapped her.</i>

26
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:16,496
<i>Robert started a war</i>
<i>to win her back.</i>

27
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:19,700
<i>He killed Rhaegar,</i>
<i>but she died anyway.</i>

28
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:23,270
That's where
I saw father.

29
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:28,140
You see?
He's not here.

30
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,784
-<i>Here, Shaggydog.</i>
-Rickon!

31
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,719
That beast

32
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:43,155
is supposed to be
chained in the kennels!

33
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,392
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

34
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:49,762
- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see father.

35
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:52,431
How many times have I told you?
He's in King's Landing

36
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,634
with Sansa and Arya.

37
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:57,070
He was down here.
I saw him.

38
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:58,838
Saw him when?

39
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:00,673
<i>Last night,</i>

40
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,342
when I was sleeping.

41
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:05,877
Here, Shaggydog.

42
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,750
You both miss him.

43
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:15,786
It's only natural
he should be in your thoughts

44
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:19,623
and dreams,
but that doesn't mean that--

45
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:22,427
Bran...

46
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:41,915
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

47
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,750
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

48
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:46,252
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

49
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:49,388
My Lady.

50
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:38,671
Robb.

51
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,941
Robb.

52
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,880
<i>Robb!</i>

53
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:54,253
You've ruined your sword.

54
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:06,165
Shh shh.

55
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,934
- Shh.
- I'll kill them all--

56
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:12,471
--Every one of them.

57
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:15,741
I will kill them all.

58
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:20,146
My boy.

59
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:24,716
They have your sisters.

60
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:28,053
We have to get
the girls back.

61
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:32,825
And then we will
kill them all.

Isn't it a funny song?

77
00:08:48,572 --> 00:08:50,473
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for your rendition.</i>

78
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:53,475
I imagine it was even better
received at that tavern.

79
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,544
I'm so sorry,
Your Grace.

80
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,545
I'll never sing it again,
I swear.

81
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,714
Tell me,
which do you favor:

82
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,450
<i>Your fingers</i>
<i>or your tongue?</i>

83
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:04,152
Your Grace?

84
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,088
Fingers
or your tongue?

85
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:09,258
If you got to keep one,
which would it be?

86
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:11,961
I-- I--

87
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:14,230
or I could just
cut your throat.

88
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:18,067
Every man needs hands,
Your Grace.

89
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:19,669
Good.

90
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:22,538
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

91
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:24,640
I won't sing--
Your Grace.

92
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:26,809
Ser Ilyn,
who better than you

93
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:28,945
- to carry out the sentence?
- I beg you!

94
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:30,480
Please no.

95
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:33,883
<i>No!</i>

96
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:39,021
Your Grace, please.
I beg you, I will never sing again!

97
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,957
- I'm done for the day.
- <i>No-oooo!</i>

98
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:43,603
I'll leave the rest
of the matters to you, mother.

99
00:09:46,932 --> 00:09:49,433
Your Grace, please!

100
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:58,710
You look quite nice.

101
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:00,479
Thank you, My Lord.

102
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:02,981
"Your Grace."
I'm King now.

103
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:06,418
<i>Stop-ppp!</i>
<i>No!</i>

104
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:09,220
Walk with me.
I want to show you something.

105
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:16,327
Do as you're bid, child.

106
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:25,603
...And as soon as you've had
your blood, I'll put a son in you.

107
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,407
Mother says that
shouldn't be long.

108
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,580
No, please no!

109
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,448
This one's your father.

110
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,685
This one here.

111
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,154
Look at it and see
what happens to traitors.

112
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:46,191
- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.

113
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:48,494
I gave him
a clean death.

114
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,196
Look at him.

115
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,532
Please let me go home.
I won't do any treason, I swear.

116
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:58,102
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here

117
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:00,805
and obey.

118
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,140
Look at him!

119
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:13,385
<i>Well?</i>

120
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:16,322
How long
do I have to look?

121
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:20,560
As long as it pleases me.

122
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,698
Do you want
to see the rest?

123
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:26,967
If it please Your Grace.

124
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,303
That's your Septa there.

125
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,606
<i>I'll tell you what:</i>

126
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,975
I'm going to give you
a present.

127
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,779
After I raise my armies
and kill your traitor brother,

128
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:41,281
I'm going to give you
his head as well.

129
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:44,017
Or maybe he'll
give me yours.

130
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:52,691
My mother tells me a King
should never strike his lady.

131
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,628
Ser Meryn.

132
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,484
Here, girl.

133
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:24,889
Will you obey now?

134
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,458
Or do you need
another lesson?

135
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,198
I'll look for you
in court.

136
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:38,303
Save yourself
some pain, girl.

137
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:40,305
Give him what he wants.

138
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:44,075
You'll be
needing that again.

139
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:07,533
The proper course
is clear:

140
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:10,003
Pledge fealty to King Renly
and move south

141
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:12,072
to join our forces
with his.

142
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:14,841
<i>Renly is not the King.</i>

143
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:18,111
You cannot mean
to hold to Joffrey, My Lord.

144
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:19,946
He put your father
to death.

145
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,881
That doesn't
make Renly King.

146
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,651
He's Robert's
<i>youngest</i> brother.

147
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:27,787
If Bran can't be Lord
of Winterfell before me,

148
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:29,789
<i>Renly can't be King</i>
<i>before Stannis.</i>

149
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:31,891
Do you mean to declare us
for Stannis?

150
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:33,774
- Renly is not right!
- My Lords.

151
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:35,544
If we put ourselves
behind Stannis--

152
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:36,769
My Lords!

153
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:40,766
Here is what I say
to these two Kings--

154
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,438
Renly Baratheon
is nothing to me,

155
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:48,841
nor Stannis neither.

156
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,410
Why should they rule
over me and mine

157
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,579
from some flowery seat
in the South?

158
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:57,816
<i>What do they know of the Wall</i>
<i>or the Wolfswood?</i>

159
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:00,819
Even their Gods
are wrong!

160
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:07,159
Why shouldn't we rule
ourselves again?

161
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:10,329
It was the Dragons
we bowed to

162
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:13,432
and now the Dragons
are dead!

163
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:17,770
There sits the only King

164
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:21,040
I mean to bend
my knee to--

165
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:23,475
the King
in the North!

166
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:32,918
I'll have peace
on those terms.

167
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:35,622
<i>They can keep</i>
<i>their Red Castle</i>

168
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:38,525
and their Iron Chair too.

169
00:14:39,894 --> 00:14:41,528
The King
in the North!

170
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:46,433
Am I your brother,
now and always?

171
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,068
Now and always.

172
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:54,743
My sword is yours,
in victory and defeat

173
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:57,880
from this day
until my last day.

174
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:00,482
The King
in the North!

175
00:15:00,517 --> 00:15:04,420
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

176
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:06,956
The King
in the North!

177
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,858
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

178
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,959
The King
in the North!

179
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,094
The King in the North!

180
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,230
The King
in the North!

181
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:17,898
<i>The King in the North!</i>

182
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:23,904
<i>The King in the North!</i>
<i>The King in the North!</i>

183
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:30,778
- Lady Stark.
- I want to see him.

184
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,480
Now!

185
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,102
Leave us.

186
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:03,611
You look lovely
tonight, Lady Stark.

187
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:06,046
<i>Widowhood becomes you.</i>

188
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,817
Your bed must be lonely.

189
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:12,619
Is that why you came?

190
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:15,255
<i>I'm not at my best,</i>

191
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:17,491
but I think I could
be of service.

192
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:21,361
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if I'm up to it.

193
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:28,868
Oh, I do like
a violent woman.

194
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:31,838
I will kill you
tonight, Ser,

195
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:35,676
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

196
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,211
<i>Let me show you how--</i>

197
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:39,747
hit me again,
over the ear.

198
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,715
And again and again.

199
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,752
You're stronger than you look--
it shouldn't take long.

200
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,720
That is what you want
the world to believe,

201
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,589
isn't it?
That you don't fear death.

202
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:50,457
But I don't, My Lady.

203
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:54,027
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

204
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:56,629
Because you are going
to the deepest

205
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:59,065
of the Seven Hells,
if the Gods are just.

206
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:01,267
What Gods are those?

207
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:04,003
The trees your husband
prayed to?

208
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:08,608
<i>Where were the trees when his</i>
<i>head was getting chopped off?</i>

209
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:11,578
If your Gods are real
and if they are just,

210
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:14,747
why is the world
so full of injustice?

211
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:19,018
Because of men like you.

212
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:21,688
There are no men like me.

213
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,691
Only me.

214
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:32,200
My son Bran.

215
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:35,803
How did he come to fall
from that tower?

216
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:38,406
I pushed him
out the window.

217
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,410
Why?

218
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,882
I hoped the fall
would kill him.

219
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,950
Why?

220
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,693
You should get some sleep.

221
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:01,129
It's going to be
a long war.

222
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:28,491
I can't believe
we're actually at war.

223
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:32,796
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

224
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:38,602
What does it say?

225
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:41,738
Have we captured
Robb Stark yet?

226
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:44,674
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

227
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:47,911
Get back into bed.

228
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,886
They have my son.

229
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,625
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

230
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,929
I've heard his wolf killed a doze
men and as many horses.

231
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:08,730
Is it true about
Stannis and Renly?

232
00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:11,533
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

233
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,136
Jaime captured,
his armies scattered...

234
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,071
It's a catastrophe.

235
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:19,107
Perhaps we should
sue for peace.

236
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:24,714
There's your peace.

237
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:28,717
Joffrey saw to that when h
decided to remove Ned Stark's head.

238
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:32,188
<i>You'll have an easier time</i>
<i>drinking from that cup</i>

239
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:35,525
<i>than you will bringing Robb Stark</i>
<i>to the table now.</i>

240
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,060
He's winning...

241
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,062
in case you
hadn't noticed.

242
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:40,597
I'm told we still
have his sisters.

243
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:43,266
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

244
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:45,169
No truces.
We can't afford to look weak.

245
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,804
<i>We should march</i>
<i>on them at once.</i>

246
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:49,440
<i>First we must return</i>
<i>to Casterly Rock to raise--</i>

247
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:51,942
They have my son!

248
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:56,681
Get out, all of you.

249
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,394
Not you.

250
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:27,179
You were right
about Eddard Stark.

251
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:31,015
If he were alive,
we could have used him

252
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:34,318
to broker a peace
with Winterfell and Riverrun,

253
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:36,687
which would have
given us more time

254
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:39,557
to deal with Robert's brothers.
But now...

255
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:43,828
Madness--
madness and stupidity.

256
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:49,835
I always thought
you were a stunted fool.

257
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:53,138
Perhaps I was wrong.

258
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,442
Half wrong.

259
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:59,213
I'm new to strategy, but--

260
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,481
unless we want to be
surrounded by three armies,

261
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:03,550
<i>it appears we can't</i>
<i>stay here.</i>

262
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:05,485
No one will stay here.

263
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,954
Ser Gregor will head out
with 500 riders

264
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:12,892
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

265
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:16,395
The rest of us will
regroup at Harrenhal.

266
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:20,633
And you will go
to King's Landing.

267
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,868
And do what?

268
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:24,804
Rule!

269
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:27,706
You will serve as Hand
of the King in my stead.

270
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,776
You will bring that boy King to heel
and his mother too, if needs be.

271
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,480
And if you get so much as a whiff
of treason from any of the rest:

272
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:38,550
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle--
- Heads, spikes, walls.

273
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:41,787
Why not my Uncle?

274
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:44,389
Why not anyone?
Why me?

275
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:46,992
You're my son.

276
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:56,502
Oh, one more thing:

277
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:59,939
You will not take
the whore to court.

278
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:01,907
Do you understand?

279
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,795
Ser Jorah?

280
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:30,368
Gently gently.

281
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:33,837
My son...

282
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:36,373
Where is he?
I want him.

283
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,777
Where is he?

284
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:45,115
The boy did not live.

285
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:54,926
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

286
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:57,362
How did my son die?!

287
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,867
He never lived,
My Princess.

288
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:03,969
The women say...

289
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:05,771
What do the women say?

290
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:11,644
- They say the child was--
- <i>Monstrous,</i>

291
00:23:11,678 --> 00:23:13,312
twisted.

292
00:23:13,346 --> 00:23:15,347
I pulled him out
myself.

293
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:19,251
He was scaled
like a lizard,

294
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:23,655
<i>blind, with leather wings</i>
<i>like the wings of a bat.</i>

295
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,925
When I touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

296
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:30,896
Inside he was
full of graveworms.

297
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:37,670
I warned you that only death
can pay for life.

298
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:39,839
You knew the price.

299
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:42,809
Where is Khal Drogo?

300
00:23:42,843 --> 00:23:44,944
Show him to me.

301
00:23:44,978 --> 00:23:47,513
Show me what I bought

302
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:50,449
with my son's life.

303
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:52,551
As you command, lady.

304
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:54,252
Come.

305
00:23:54,286 --> 00:23:56,087
I will take you
to him.

306
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:59,056
- Time enough for that later--
- I want to see him now.

307
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:17,010
The Khalasar is gone.

308
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:19,646
A Khal who cannot ride
is no Khal.

309
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:22,516
The Dothraki
follow only the strong.

310
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,218
I'm sorry, My Princess.

311
00:24:37,065 --> 00:24:38,165
Drogo!

312
00:24:42,303 --> 00:24:44,204
Why is he out here alone?

313
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:47,007
He seems to like
the warmth, Princess.

314
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:52,980
<i>He lives.</i>

315
00:24:53,014 --> 00:24:55,816
<i>You asked for life,</i>
<i>you paid for life.</i>

316
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,452
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

317
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:01,855
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east

318
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,924
<i>when the seas go dry.</i>

319
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:07,728
When the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

320
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:24,580
Leave us.

321
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:28,317
I don't want you alone
with this sorceress.

322
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:31,554
I have nothing more
to fear from this woman.

323
00:25:32,456 --> 00:25:34,056
Go.

324
00:25:39,896 --> 00:25:43,232
You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.

325
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:46,134
It was wrong of them
to burn my temple.

326
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,105
- <i>It angered the Great Shepherd.</i>
- This is not God's work.

327
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:52,774
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

328
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:56,077
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

329
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:57,556
Now he will burn no cities.

330
00:25:57,581 --> 00:26:00,132
Now his Khalasar will trample
no nations into dust.

331
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:02,851
I spoke for you.

332
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:05,087
I saved you.

333
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:07,722
Saved me?

334
00:26:07,756 --> 00:26:09,857
Three of those riders
had already

335
00:26:09,892 --> 00:26:12,627
raped me before
you saved me, girl.

336
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:18,333
I saw my God's house burn,

337
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:22,737
there where I had healed men
and women beyond counting.

338
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:25,439
In the streets
I saw piles of heads--

339
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:28,009
the head of the Baker
who makes my bread,

340
00:26:28,043 --> 00:26:29,443
the head of a young boy

341
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:32,313
that I had cured of fever
just three moons past.

342
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:36,317
So tell me again
exactly what it was

343
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:37,719
that you saved.

344
00:26:37,753 --> 00:26:39,687
Your life.

345
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:41,722
Hmph.

346
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:44,358
Why don't you take
a look at your Khal...

347
00:26:46,128 --> 00:26:48,963
Then you will see
exactly what life is worth

348
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:51,799
when all the rest has gone.

349
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:06,714
You can't!

350
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:08,950
Get out of my way, Sam.

351
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:11,285
They'll put out the word.

352
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,222
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

353
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:17,092
Do you know what happens
to deserters?

354
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:21,696
Better than you do.

355
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,399
What are you going to do?

356
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,334
I'm gonna find my brother

357
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:29,404
and put a sword through
King Joffrey's throat.

358
00:27:30,573 --> 00:27:33,709
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

359
00:27:33,743 --> 00:27:37,746
- Move.
- I won't let you go.

360
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,682
- Move.
- No.

361
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:43,418
Hyah!

362
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,072
Hand of the King?

363
00:28:01,106 --> 00:28:03,107
So it would seem.

364
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:07,645
And your father said you couldn't take
anyone with you to King's Landing.

365
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,615
No, he said I couldn't take <i>you</i>
with me to King's Landing.

366
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,317
He was very specific
on that point.

367
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:14,352
He knew my name?

368
00:28:14,386 --> 00:28:16,120
What?

369
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,722
He said, "Don't bring Shae
with you to King's Landing"?

370
00:28:18,757 --> 00:28:21,858
I believe he used
the word "whore."

371
00:28:23,027 --> 00:28:24,994
Are you ashamed of me?

372
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:28,064
Are you afraid that I'm dancing
around the court with my tits out?

373
00:28:28,098 --> 00:28:31,200
I'm funny now?

374
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:33,436
I'm Shae the funny whore.

375
00:28:34,905 --> 00:28:37,907
My father's probably the most
powerful man in the country.

376
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:39,208
Certainly the richest.

377
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:41,844
<i>He has all Seven Kingdoms</i>
<i>in his pockets.</i>

378
00:28:41,878 --> 00:28:43,679
Everyone everywhere

379
00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:46,849
always has to do exactly
what my father says.

380
00:28:48,318 --> 00:28:50,286
He's always been a cunt.

381
00:28:57,228 --> 00:28:58,895
I believe the ladies
of the court

382
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,032
<i>could learn a great deal</i>
<i>from a girl like you.</i>

383
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:06,003
Why don't you
come with me,

384
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:08,772
<i>be the Hand's lady?</i>

385
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:12,976
Because the King needs
a Hand and the Hand--

386
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:20,084
I know what
a Hand needs.

387
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:35,033
- Ghost?
- <i>Hyah!</i>

388
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:37,936
- Hyah.
- Hyah!

389
00:29:41,341 --> 00:29:42,975
Hyah.

390
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:48,514
<i>Samwell!</i>

391
00:29:49,783 --> 00:29:52,418
<i>- Is he dead?</i>
<i>- No, he's not dead.</i>

392
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:54,020
<i>Did we get him?</i>

393
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:56,155
<i>Come on, help me</i>
<i>get him up.</i>

394
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:01,694
Lucky you've got
plenty of padding.

395
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:05,565
We're taking you back
to where you belong.

396
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,201
- I belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

397
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:10,503
They'll kill you if they find out
you've gone.

398
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:12,638
They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.

399
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:15,675
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

400
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:18,578
- <i>We're sorry about your father.</i>
- But it doesn't matter.

401
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:20,847
You took the oath.
You can't leave.

402
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:23,016
- I have to.
- You can't.

403
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,552
- You said the words.
- I don't care about--

404
00:30:25,587 --> 00:30:28,722
"Hear my words and bear
witness to my vow..."

405
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:30,694
To hell with all of you.

406
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:33,041
"Night gathers and now
my Watch begins.

407
00:30:33,195 --> 00:30:36,531
It shall not end
until my death.

408
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:38,332
I shall live and die
at my post."

409
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,268
"I am the sword
in the darkness..."

410
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:42,336
"...The Watcher on the Walls,

411
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:44,773
the shield that guards
the realms of men.

412
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:48,510
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch,

413
00:30:48,544 --> 00:30:52,647
for this night
and all nights to come."

414
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:38,887
When the sun

415
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:41,323
rises in the west

416
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:44,793
and sets in the east...

417
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,499
Then you shall return
to me, my sun and stars.

418
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:01,169
Kings?

419
00:34:01,203 --> 00:34:05,273
Oh, I can tell you all
there is to know about Kings.

420
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:10,445
The thing you need to
understand about Kings is...

421
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:19,021
For the past 67 years,
I've known--

422
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:24,127
truly known more Kings
than any man alive.

423
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:30,199
They're complicated men,
but I know how to serve them.

424
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,135
Yes.

425
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:34,771
And keep on serving them.

426
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,777
Aerys Targaryen...

427
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:45,282
of all the thousand thousand
maladies the Gods visit on us,

428
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:49,018
madness is the worst.

429
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:51,954
He was a good man,

430
00:34:51,988 --> 00:34:55,157
such a charmer.

431
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:59,328
To watch him melt away
before my eyes,

432
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:01,396
consumed by dreams

433
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:04,599
of fire and blood...

434
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:09,605
Robert Baratheon

435
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:12,574
was an entirely different animal--
powerful man,

436
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:14,744
a great warrior--

437
00:35:14,778 --> 00:35:17,747
but alas,
winning a Kingdom

438
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:21,718
and ruling a Kingdom
are rather different things.

439
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,053
They say that

440
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:27,523
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

441
00:35:27,557 --> 00:35:29,858
he can often be blind

442
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:32,728
to the enemies at his side.

443
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:38,366
Now I serve his son

444
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,634
King Joffrey,

445
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:42,870
may the Gods
bless his reign.

446
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,943
He is a capable young man--
strong military mind.

447
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:51,213
Stern...

448
00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:55,218
But sternness in defense
of the realm is no vice.

449
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,889
It's far too soon to know what
manner of King he will be,

450
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,524
but I sense

451
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,595
true greatness on the horizon
for our new King.

452
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:11,066
True greatness.

453
00:36:15,305 --> 00:36:17,438
So what's the thing?

454
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,908
What thing?

455
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:22,610
About Kings.

456
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:25,780
You said, "the thing you need
to understand about Kings..."

457
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:28,549
What? Things?
What?

458
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:31,385
When you started, you--
never mind.

459
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,455
Let me see you
out, my dear.

460
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:38,392
- It's all right. No need.
- <i>Yes yes.</i>

461
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:40,860
Till the next time.

462
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,748
Right.

463
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:32,178
When you imagine yourself up
there, how do you look?

464
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:36,383
Does the crown fit?
Do all the lords and ladies

465
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:40,253
simper and bow, the ones who
sneered at you for years?

466
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:43,589
It's hard for them to simper
and bow without heads.

467
00:37:44,891 --> 00:37:47,393
A man with great ambition
and no morals--

468
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:49,795
I wouldn't
bet against you.

469
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,631
And what would you do,
my friend,

470
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:54,033
if you found yourself
sitting up there?

471
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,936
I must be one of the few men
in this city

472
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,605
who doesn't
want to be King.

473
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,674
You must be one
of the few men in the city

474
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,042
who isn't a man.

475
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:04,945
Oh, you can do
better than that.

476
00:38:09,283 --> 00:38:12,585
When they castrated you, did they
take the pillar with the stones?

477
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,554
- I've always wondered.
- Have you?

478
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:17,591
Do you spend a lot of time wondering
what's between my legs?

479
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,727
I picture a gash

480
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:23,196
like a woman's.
Is that about right?

481
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,065
I am flattered, of course,
to be pictured at all.

482
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:29,668
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years--

483
00:38:29,703 --> 00:38:32,738
a man from another land,

484
00:38:32,772 --> 00:38:35,440
despised by most,

485
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:36,908
feared by all--

486
00:38:36,943 --> 00:38:38,510
am I?
That is good to know.

487
00:38:38,544 --> 00:38:41,813
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

488
00:38:41,847 --> 00:38:45,750
But you carry on,
whispering in one King's ear

489
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,386
and then the next.

490
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:52,357
I admire you.

491
00:38:52,392 --> 00:38:55,060
And I admire you,
Lord Baelish.

492
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:58,097
A grasper from a minor house
with a major talent

493
00:38:58,131 --> 00:39:00,266
<i>for befriending</i>
<i>powerful men--</i>

494
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,397
and women.

495
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,148
A useful talent,
I'm sure you'd agree.

496
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:09,241
So here we stand...

497
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:12,477
In mutual admiration
and respect.

498
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:14,679
Playing our roles.

499
00:39:14,714 --> 00:39:16,581
Serving a new King.

500
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:18,550
Long may he reign.

501
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:20,819
- My King.
- My King.

502
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:25,190
My Lords.
Shall we begin?

503
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:28,227
<i>You're Arry now, hear me?</i>

504
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:30,496
Arry the orphan boy.

505
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,798
No one asks an orphan
too many questions

506
00:39:32,832 --> 00:39:35,034
'cause nobody gives
three shits.

507
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:36,369
What's your name?

508
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:38,171
- Arry.
- Ah.

509
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:41,775
We have a long way
to travel and in bad company.

510
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:43,977
I have 20 this time,

511
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:46,079
men and boys all
bound for the Wall.

512
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:49,816
Your Lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons

513
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,985
and I didn't find
no little lordlings down there.

514
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,256
This lot, half of them would
turn you over to the King

515
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,391
quick as spit for a pardon.

516
00:39:58,425 --> 00:40:00,460
And the other half
would do the same,

517
00:40:00,494 --> 00:40:02,696
except they'd
rape you first.

518
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,031
So keep to yourself--
and when you piss,

519
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:07,233
do it in the woods alone.

520
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:10,936
You stay
with this lot, boy.

521
00:40:10,971 --> 00:40:12,571
And stay--

522
00:40:12,606 --> 00:40:16,442
or I'll lock you in the back of
the wagon with these three.

523
00:40:20,313 --> 00:40:22,114
Watch yourself,
midget.

524
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:25,384
He's got a sword,
this one.

525
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:27,921
What's a gutter rat
like you doing with a sword?

526
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:31,158
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

527
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:32,793
He looks like a girl.

528
00:40:32,827 --> 00:40:35,028
I bet he stole
that sword.

529
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:37,697
Let's have a look.

530
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:41,968
I could use me
a sword like that.

531
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:44,237
- <i>Take it off him.</i>
- Give it here, midget.

532
00:40:44,271 --> 00:40:45,438
Look at him!

533
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:47,573
You'd better give
Hot Pie the sword.

534
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:49,309
I've seen him
kick a boy to death.

535
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:51,711
I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls

536
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:54,113
and I kept kicking him
until he was dead.

537
00:40:54,148 --> 00:40:57,583
I kicked him
all to pieces.

538
00:40:57,617 --> 00:41:00,653
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

539
00:41:00,687 --> 00:41:02,521
I'll give it to you.

540
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:05,258
I already killed
one fat boy.

541
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:07,526
I bet you never
killed anyone.

542
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:10,596
I bet you're a liar.
But I'm not.

543
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:12,398
I'm good at killing
fat boys.

544
00:41:12,432 --> 00:41:14,734
I like killing fat boys.

545
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:18,371
Oh, you like picking
on the little ones, do you?

546
00:41:18,405 --> 00:41:21,241
You know, I've been hammering
an anvil these past 10 years.

547
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:24,311
When I hit
that steel, it sings.

548
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:26,646
Are you gonna sing
when I hit you?

549
00:41:33,287 --> 00:41:35,521
This is
castle-forged steel.

550
00:41:35,555 --> 00:41:37,689
Where'd you steal it?

551
00:41:37,724 --> 00:41:40,158
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

552
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:42,794
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

553
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:45,931
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen--

554
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:48,033
murderers.

555
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:51,570
- Which are you?
- Armorer's apprentice.

556
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:55,574
But my master
got sick of me,

557
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:56,876
so here I am.

558
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,912
<i>Come on, you sorry</i>
<i>sons of whores!</i>

559
00:41:59,947 --> 00:42:03,248
It's a thousand leagues
from here to the Wall

560
00:42:03,282 --> 00:42:05,917
and winter is coming!

561
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:38,383
Ham.

562
00:42:38,418 --> 00:42:40,886
How many days in a row
must a man be

563
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:43,523
expected to start
his day with ham?

564
00:42:43,557 --> 00:42:46,526
Bring me some beer
at least.

565
00:42:48,562 --> 00:42:50,497
You look exhausted.

566
00:42:50,531 --> 00:42:52,766
Was your moonlight ride
that tiring?

567
00:42:56,404 --> 00:42:58,271
Don't look so terrified.

568
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:01,175
If we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

569
00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:03,744
only ghosts
would guard the Wall.

570
00:43:03,778 --> 00:43:07,315
At least you weren't
whoring in Mole's Town.

571
00:43:08,283 --> 00:43:10,051
Honor made you leave,

572
00:43:10,085 --> 00:43:11,887
honor brought you back.

573
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:15,056
My friends
brought me back.

574
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:17,827
I didn't say
it was your honor.

575
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,796
They killed my father.

576
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,599
And you're going to bring him
back to life, are you?

577
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,968
No? Good.

578
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,804
We've had enough
of that sort of thing.

579
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:30,873
Beyond the Wall,
the rangers are

580
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,375
reporting whole villages
abandoned.

581
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,779
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

582
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:38,880
from dusk until dawn.

583
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:43,551
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

584
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:47,189
<i>to what ends</i>
<i>the Gods only know.</i>

585
00:43:47,223 --> 00:43:49,457
Outside Eastwatch

586
00:43:49,492 --> 00:43:52,861
Cotter Pyke's men discovered four
blue-eyed corpses.

587
00:43:52,895 --> 00:43:57,298
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

588
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:02,370
Do you think
your brother's war

589
00:44:02,404 --> 00:44:04,905
is more important
than ours?

590
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:09,644
- No.
- When dead men and worse

591
00:44:09,678 --> 00:44:12,580
come hunting for us in the night,
do you think it matters

592
00:44:12,614 --> 00:44:15,117
<i>who sits</i>
<i>on the Iron Throne?</i>

593
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:17,586
- No.
- Good.

594
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,490
Because I want you
and your wolf with us

595
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,726
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

596
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,862
Beyond the Wall?

597
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,631
I'll not sit meekly by

598
00:44:28,665 --> 00:44:30,599
and wait for the snows.

599
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,035
<i>I mean to find out</i>
<i>what's happening.</i>

600
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:35,738
<i>The Night's Watch will</i>
<i>ride in force</i>

601
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,374
<i>against the wildlings,</i>
<i>the White Walkers</i>

602
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,410
<i>and whatever else</i>
<i>is out there.</i>

603
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,749
<i>And we will find Benjen Stark,</i>

604
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,985
<i>alive or dead.</i>

605
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,255
<i>I will command them</i>
<i>myself.</i>

606
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,490
<i>So I'll only ask you once,</i>
<i>Lord Snow...</i>

607
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:56,160
<i>Move out!</i>

608
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,863
<i>...Are you a brother</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch</i>

609
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:02,700
<i>or a bastard boy</i>
<i>who wants to play at war?</i>

610
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:48,746
Drogo will have no use for
dragon eggs in the Night Lands.

611
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:51,916
Sell them. You can return
to the Free Cities

612
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,285
and live as a wealthy woman
for all your days.

613
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,821
They were not
given to me to sell.

614
00:46:02,294 --> 00:46:04,862
Khaleesi, My Queen,

615
00:46:04,897 --> 00:46:08,233
I vow to serve you,
obey you,

616
00:46:08,267 --> 00:46:10,602
to die for you
if need be,

617
00:46:10,636 --> 00:46:13,405
but let him go,
Khaleesi.

618
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,208
I know what you intend.
Do not.

619
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:19,078
I must.

620
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:21,213
You don't understand--

621
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:24,750
don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

622
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:27,286
I won't watch you burn.

623
00:46:28,923 --> 00:46:31,091
Is that what you fear?

624
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,812
You will be my Khalasar.

625
00:46:52,846 --> 00:46:56,282
I see the faces of slaves.

626
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:58,951
I free you.

627
00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:03,689
Take off your collars. Go if yo
wish, no one will stop you.

628
00:47:03,723 --> 00:47:06,192
But if you stay,

629
00:47:06,226 --> 00:47:09,896
it will be as
brothers and sisters,

630
00:47:09,964 --> 00:47:13,566
<i>as husbands and wives.</i>

631
00:47:24,277 --> 00:47:26,812
Ser Jorah, bind this woman
to the pyre.

632
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,785
You swore to obey me.

633
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,399
I am Daenerys Stormborn

634
00:47:43,433 --> 00:47:46,201
of House Targaryen

635
00:47:46,235 --> 00:47:48,470
of the blood of Old Valyria.

636
00:47:48,504 --> 00:47:51,106
I am the Dragon's daughter.

637
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,575
And I swear to you

638
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,180
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

639
00:47:57,214 --> 00:47:59,082
You will not
hear me scream.

640
00:47:59,116 --> 00:48:01,150
I will.

641
00:48:03,121 --> 00:48:05,655
But it is not
your screams I want.

642
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,192
Only your life.

643
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:41,278
Blood of my blood.
