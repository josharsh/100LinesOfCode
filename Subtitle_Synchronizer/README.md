# Subtitle Synchronizer
Sometimes the subtitles are out of sync. This fixes it!
  
# How to use?
  1. Make a copy of your subtitle filee and rename it to "input.srt"
  2. Make sure this "input.srt" is in the same folder as the program.
  3. Run the program.
  4. After running it you will be prompted to enter the shift you want to apply to the subtitle.
  5. To shift it forward, enter the shift in negative (-2301 shifts the subtitles forward by 2301 milliseconds)
  6. To shift it backward, enter the shift in positive (2301 shifts the subtitles backward by 2301 milliseconds)
  7. An "output.srt" will be made. Copy its content to your original subtitle file, sitback and enjoy the movieüçª.

# Example
  I have added sample input and output where I have applied a shift of 500.
