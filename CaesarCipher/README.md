# Caesar Cipher
A simple script that applies a caesar cipher onto the input

Note that the cipher doesn't work with symbols, but does work with numbers.

## How to run
In the terminal run

`py CaesarCipher.py` or `python CaesarCipher.py` (windows)

For linux and mac you might want to try something like

`python3 CaesarCipher.py` if the commands above didn't work.
