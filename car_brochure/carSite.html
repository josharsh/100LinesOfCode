            <div class="panel"><p><b>Unmistakable Presence</b></p>
                <p>Like the archetypal hunter, the V8 Coupe's silhouette has been finely tuned for stealth and survival. Its sleek form creates a predatory stance, while its muscular flanks and powerful haunches are poised to leap into action as soon as the engine roars.</p>
                <p><b>A Statement of Intent</b></p>
                <p>The signature ultra-slim light graphic illuminates the full width of the tailgate, accentuated by the flick in the Vantage's tail. Such a provocative nod to the car's wild character only makes you want to tame it more.</p>
                <p><b>Natural Selection</b></p>
                <p>The nose of the clamshell bonnet is pitched towards the ground, as if tracking its prey. The three-dimensional S curve around the grille adds ferocity to its expression and ultra-slim headlights give you a glimpse of its soul.</p>
            </div><br><br>
            <button class="accordion">Interior: Ultra Compact</button>
            <div class="panel"><p><b>Intelligently Crafted</b></p>
                <p>The interior is you, personified. Look around. Sink into it. The perfectly-positioned sport-orientated gearshift paddles. The gear selection buttons waiting impatiently in the centre console. The Aston Martin Audio System, 8" LED screen and integrated satellite navigation system surrounding you so everything you need is focused, functional, fast and supremely thrilling.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Performance: The Pulsing Heart</button>
            <div class="panel"><p><b>Intense and Beautiful</b></p>
                <p>Vantage’s high-performance V8 power house is positioned low and further back in the chassis to improve weight distribution and driving dynamics, leaving a lasting impression well beyond the drive. Effortless, inherent potency comes from the engine’s extraordinary 510 PS output and 685 Nm of torque fed through Vantage’s ZF automatic transmission. The eight-speed gearbox delivers the perfect balance of performance and refinement, with adaptive software designed to gauge the operating conditions – along with the demands the driver is making – to ensure the car is in exactly the right gear at the right time.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Engineering: Athletic Pose and Agility</button>
            <div class="panel"><p><b>Ultimate Response</b></p>
                <p>The V8 Coupe has exceptional cornering, manoeuvrability and high speed stability. That's because of the Electronic Rear Differential, a technical innovation that's a first for Aston Martin. Combine that with Dynamic Torque Vectoring and you're about to enjoy a whole new level of driving thrill.</p>
