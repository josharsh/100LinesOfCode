        "\n",
        "To avoid re-requesting the same data, we will use a programming pattern known as caching. It works like this:\n",
        "- Before doing some expensive operation (like calling requests.get to get data from a REST API), check whether you have already saved (“cached”) the results that would be generated by making that request.\n",
        "- If so, return that same data.\n",
        "- If not, perform the expensive operation and save (“cache”) the results (e.g. the complicated data) in your cache so you won’t have to perform it again the next time.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you go on to learn about web development, you’ll find that you encounter caching all the time – if you’ve ever had the experience of seeing old data when you go to a website and thinking, “Huh, that’s weird, it should really be different now… why am I still seeing that?” that happens because the browser has accessed a cached version of the site.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are at least four reasons why caching is a good idea during your software development using REST APIs:\n",
        "- It reduces load on the website that is providing you data. It is always nice to be courteous when using other people’s resources. Moreover, some websites impose rate limits: for example, after 15 requests in a 15 minute period, the site may start sending error responses. That will be confusing and annoying for you.\n",
        "- It will make your program run faster. Connections over the Internet can take a few seconds, or even tens of seconds, if you are requesting a lot of data. It might not seem like much, but debugging is a lot easier when you can make a change in your program, run it, and get an almost instant response.\n",
        "- It is harder to debug the code that processes complicated data if the content that is coming back can change on each run of your code. It’s amazing to be able to write programs that fetch real-time data like the available iTunes podcasts or the latest tweets from Twitter. But it can be hard to debug that code if you are having problems that only occur on certain Tweets (e.g. those in foreign languages). When you encounter problematic data, it’s helpful if you save a copy and can debug your program working on that saved, static copy of the data.\n",
        "- It is easier to run automated tests on code that retrieves data if the data can never change, for the same reasons it is helpful for debugging. In fact, we rely on use of cached data in the automated tests that check your code in exercises.\n"
