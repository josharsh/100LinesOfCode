## Motivation
A spiffy bash app to feed you with motivation from your command line!
With over 300 quotes chosen at random.

## Installation
You can simply run the command **bash motivate.sh** if your terminal is in the working directory.

If you'd like access to the motivate command system wide modify your .bashrc with a alias command. Typically in a Linux system:

1. type nano ~/.bashrc
2. add  ``` alias motivate='bash path/to/motivate.sh'```
3. save and open a new terminal session. Type ```motivate``` and you should be greeted with a quote.

If you are on Mac or Windows refer to your respective .bashrc file and follow the steps above with a text editor.

### Customizing

Feel free to add more amazing quotes to the motivation.txt file. Just keep the text file in the same director as the motivation.sh file and update the number on the 2nd line to reflect the number of quotes.
