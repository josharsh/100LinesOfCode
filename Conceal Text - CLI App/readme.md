# Conceal Text
Conceal Text is a python based CLI application has the following functionalities:

Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher 
in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet 
and Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.
