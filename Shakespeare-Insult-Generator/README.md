# ðŸ¥€ Shakespeare Insult Generator ðŸ’€

Is the following right up your alley?

> How do you do, thou fawning fool-born boar-pig?

Then you're in for a treat, because with the Shakepeare Insult Generator, you'll never be short for words in an argument.

## Requirements

You'll need to have some recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

## Updating

All of the insults are split between a _verb_, _adjective_ and _noun_ and these can be found in the `insults.json` file. Feel free to change if you like. The app has been built to iterate over all of the available keys. So if you'd like to add another _verb_ on the `json` file, running the `app.js` will add it to the insult without a need for a code change.

## Running

Navigate your command line interface of preference to the folder of this project, then run the following command:

```
node app.js
```

Prepare to be insulted with the most victorian type of slander, thou **puny beef-witted giglet**!
