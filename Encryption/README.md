### CLI Based encryption tool | Built using Python

A simple project which includes in itself some famous encryption methods, such as Morse, Hex, Base64 and Caesar Cipher.
Unfortunately, It can't decrypt. But may it will be added in next version :D 

Usage:
	Download the Python File, run it using: "python enc.py" when inside the folder.
	The libraries should come installed already, but if not use:
	"python -m pip install base64"
	"python -m pip install binascii"
	
Built in Python V3.8
