## Easy Countdown timer generator!
[View demo](https://countdownbanner.vercel.app/web.html)
Imagine you're about to launch a project in a few weeks or months. How do you build anticipation? Well, you could download/purchase one of those WordPress themes that count down to a date you specified, or you can just copy one of these easy-to-customize banners and set your date to the date you expect to go live!

Once set up, it will countdown *to the second* until your product launch, website activation, event date -- anything you want!

## How to use
1. Open the web.html file. I've written it so the width adapts to all screens, but you can adapt the height to your use. 
2. Edit the content of the email, including the headlines, and the subheading. 
3. Adjust the date. Right now it's set to some ridiculous year so the countdown timer always runs in demo mode for you to see, but you should set it to the date of your anticipated launch.

Good luck with your launch, and I wish you a lot of good fortune!
