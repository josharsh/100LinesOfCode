# Tickr by Droogy
## Tickr is a program which grabs headlines from the New York Times and displays the headlines like a ticker you would see at the bottom of the screen during a news broadcast. All in less than 100 lines of Python!
## I plan on adding support to other news outlets as well as a nicer display and stricter regex to filter out garbage headlines. Enjoy!
## Make sure you have tkinter, requests, and BeautifulSoup installed.
