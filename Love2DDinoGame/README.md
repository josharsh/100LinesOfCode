# Love2D Dino Game
Simple dino game with less than 100 lines of code. This dino game is built with Love2D. Love2D or LÖVE is a framework for making 2D games in the Lua programming language. LÖVE is free and can be used in anything from friendly open-source hobby projects to evil, closed-source commercial ones.

### About
[The Dinosaur Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game) is a browser game developed by Google and built into the Google Chrome web browser. The player guides a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score. In my project, I am limiting some features like assets and other details to minimize lines of code.

### Requirements
- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) 5.*
- [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 11.*

### Installation
