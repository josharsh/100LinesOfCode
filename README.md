### About
This repository contains all the applications, extensions, add-ons, designs, themes and anything else which is productive developed in less than #100LinesOfCode.

### Here's What It Is:
Does #100DaysOfCode get too recursive for you? Are you fed up of #coding just for a #streak? Do you want to change the #trend?
Here's something fresh. This  #season let's challenge our brains to develop something productive in less than #100LinesOfCode 
Often in places close and far, we come across those little things which can really be coded to easen the process. You want to watch a youtube video at 10X?, make a browser #extension for it. If you want to add custom design themes to sites you visit, do it by designing an#extension theme. 
#100LinesOfCode is a #challenge to get your neurons together to develop anything and everything productive using less than #100LinesOfCode. It can be an android code snippet, Javascript function, a python Library usage and anything else you can think of. So run the horses, pull up the socks, grab a cup of coffee and start to code to develop something productive in #100LinesOfCode.  I have created a Github repository https://github.com/josharsh/100LinesOfCode. Navigate and contribute to #OpenSource in the process. 


## Purpose
Purpose of this repository is to promote development of productive applications and utilities which seem so common yet might not be into use. Trigger your brain, take the challenge of developing something in less than #100LinesofCode. 

## Contributing

2: Fork this repository
3: Clone this repository 
```
$ git clone "https://www.github.com/{Username}/100LinesOfCode.git"
```
where username is your GitHub account username.

4. Create a branch where you can do your local work.

```
$ git remote add upstream "https://github.com/josharsh/100LinesOfCode"
```

2. Fetch upstream changes in local machine
```
$ git fetch upstream
```

3. Switch to master branch
```
$ git checkout master
```

4. Merge changes in local machine
```
$ git merge upstream/master
```

5. Push changes to your forked GitHub repository
```
$ git push -f origin master
```

## Structure of Your Code:
The *root* directory of your developed application must contain
* A README.md describing your project, idea and Implementation
* Source code for your app
* Link to working app (In case the app in an extension, add-ons, etc.)
* If Possible, Deploy the code onto a hosting platform.

Note: Please Add Author's name in Readme.md of application.
