This is a little website I made to practice my skills

You can paste text into the box and press the button to have it all changed into upper case.

To run:
- Type node server.js
- Navigate to localhost:3000

If this is too big of a program, feel free to remove it from the repository, I wasn't sure if the JSON and node_modules counted or not.
