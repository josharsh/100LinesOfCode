# Odds or Evens Game

## Description

This is a simple game in Python, the principle is that the user will choose if they want "Odds" or "Evens", and then proceed to choose between 1 or 2.
The machine then picks a random number and adds to the 1 or 2 that the user chose. If the resultant number matches with the first choice of the player
(i.e., if the number is odd and the choise was odd, or if the number is even and the choice was even), the player wins. Otherwise, the player loses.

## How to use

To run this program, you only need Python 3 installed. To run it, you need only to run the following command:
